PS3_joystick_example
==========================

This is two sets of code that turns the PS3 controller into a usable input
device under Linux.

Note: to run these examples on the Raspberry Pi, all required libraries must be
downloaded on the Pi as well. I can't remember exactly which ones they are, but
they include:
* sdl
* [QtSixA](http://qtsixa.sourceforge.net/)
